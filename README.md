# API Discovery Solution for Microservice Architectures

### Purpose

In Microservice architectures many services and APIs are built. Over time it becomes quite hard for each developer to keep track which APIs exist and what services an API offers. As a solution for this problem, this API Discovery solution offers easy to implement [auto discovery](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/api-discovery/tree/master/crawler) of available APIs and gathers all found API specifications in one central [storage](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/api-discovery/tree/master/storage) system. It's built upon OpenAPI specifications (formerly Swagger). It also comes with an adapted [Swagger UI](swagger-ui/) to display all APIs.

**IMPORTANT** Currently the crawler is still depending on an application registry, called [Kio](https://github.com/zalando-stups/kio). From this application registry all services, which potentially have an API definition, are crawled. In near future, this will change and retrieving of crawlable services will be configurable. By this you can adapt API Disocvery to your needs. Please contribute if you have requirements or ideas to [this issue](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/api-discovery/issues/2).


### Architecture Overview

    +------------+     +---------+     +---------+     +------+
    | Swagger UI +---->+ Storage +<----+ Crawler +---->+ APIs |
    +------------+     +---------+     +---------+     +------+


### How does it work?

The crawler constantly fetches a list of all available services from an application registry
(currently [Kio](https://github.com/zalando-stups/kio)) and then tries to retrieve an API definition per service.
For that, it first crawls `/.well-known/schema-discovery` which should respond with payload like:

  ```json
  {
    "schema_url": "/swagger.json",
    "schema_type": "swagger-2.0",
    "ui_url": "/ui/"
  }
  ```

`schema_url` points to an API definition endpoint. The API definition can be provided either in JSON or YAML format.
After the crawler loaded the definition it tries to store it in the [storage](storage/) system. An adapted
[Swagger UI](swagger-ui/) displays all API definitions which were stored in this storage system.


### Dependencies

- Java 8
- NPM

### Installation

Please refer to individual installation instructions of sub-projects for more detailed information and configuration parameters.


### Run locally

You can start the whole stack (Swagger UI and Strorage incl. PostgreSQL DB) locally be building the respective sub-projects and running:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

Swagger UI is accessible on <http://localhost:8080>. You can also access Storage API <http://localhost:8010/apps> and PostgreSQL database <http://localhost:54321/apis> directly.

If your docker host is not your localhost (e.g. MacOS), replace localhost in the link with the docker machine IP address:
```bash
docker-machine ip ${machine_name}
```

- TODO add build script to automatically build projects, docker images and start docker compose (see [#8](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/api-discovery/issues/8))
